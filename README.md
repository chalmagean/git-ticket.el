# Git Ticket

Extract the ticket number from the git branch.

## Motivation

Most of my current git workflow involves creating feature branches in the form of `feature/<ticker_number>_and_the_ticket_name`. I also use the `ticket_number` to prefix all my commits so I can quickly see which ticket the commit belongs to when I look at the git log.
